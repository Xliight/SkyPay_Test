# Skypay Technical Tests – Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for two technical tests provided by Skypay, implemented in Java. Each test focuses on a different problem domain and is designed to assess object-oriented design, logic implementation, and testing practices.

## 📘 Test 1 – Banking Service

A simple banking system that allows a user to:
- **Deposit** money
- **Withdraw** money
- **Print** the bank statement (showing all transactions in reverse chronological order)


## 🏨 Test 2 – Hotel Reservation System

A mini hotel booking system to manage:
- **Users** with a balance
- **Rooms** of different types and prices
- **Bookings** based on availability and user balance

### Key Features
- Supports 3 room types: `standard`, `junior`, and `master suite`
- Prevents overlapping bookings
- Ensures users have sufficient funds
- Historical integrity: updating room prices does not impact past bookings
- Reverse chronological output of bookings and users

---

## ✅ Unit Tests

Both solutions include **unit tests** to verify correctness and edge cases. These tests cover:
- Valid and invalid transactions/bookings
- Sufficient/insufficient balance scenarios
- Room availability logic
- Output formatting checks
